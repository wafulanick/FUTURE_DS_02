SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN PERFORMANCE TRACKER


The tasks allowed me to analyze an ad campaign for Facebook, evaluating performance, engagement, the click-through rate (CTR), and the Return On Investment (ROI). I utilized MS Excel, Python and Power BI in performing this task.


I first performed data cleaning to determine whether deleting or imputing missing data was the most appropriate approach. Ultimately, I decided to use imputation, which involved determining the average value and applying it to the null values.
The dataset also allowed me to do a mix-up of various tools i.e. Python, MS Excel, and Power BI, for performing the visualization. I have exercised and improved my skills in:


Data Cleaning using Python and MS Excel
Marketing Analytics by visualizing the CTR, CPS, Reach, Impressions, and clicks
Performing campaign optimization
Data visualization using Power BI

The dashboard above shows the Facebook Ad campaign carried out and the various KPI’s and visualizations derived from the dataset. The slicers allow the users to filter the performance visualized by name of day, gender, age, and date. This gives the users a clear insight into what exactly the dataset reveals.


INSIGHTS DRAWN

The campaign was carried out for the month of August alone. 
During the month, the total clicks on the ads were 38,165, with a total of 1143 distinct customers reached. This led to a total of 3264 conversions, of which 1079 were approved. This signaled an approval conversion rate of 33.06%, a value below average. This shows a below average validation rate on our conversions.
The total cost of this entire Facebook Ad campaign stood at $58,75.23, showcasing a $1.54 cost per click. However, this only transformed to a 0.02% click-through rate; that is, for 5,592 impressions reached, only one clicked on the ad. This shows a worrisome statistic on the cost-benefit analysis of the ad campaign.


Analysis by Gender

The female gender had the highest clicks of the ad campaign, with 23,878 clicks compared to 14,287 clicks of their male counterparts.  This shows that the most viewers of the campaign are female and thus, we can focus more on reaching them in future campaigns, which may be of benefit revenue-wise.


Analysis by Age

The ages between 45-49 had the highest number of clicks with 13,852. However, of these clicks, only 684 were conversions, a 5% conversion on the clicks. On the other hand, the age between 30-34 had the lowest clicks with 9,483 clicks, of which 1,431 were conversions. A 15.09% conversion rate on the clicks.
Recommendation – The ages between 45-49 show a greater potential for conversion if we can curate products relative to their desire. With this high number of clicks, it shows a marketing potential that we can leverage to impact our revenue report.
Additionally, with the highest number of conversions, the ages between 30-34 have the potential of generating more revenue. Therefore, we recommend more campaigns geared towards this specific age group to turn this potential to reality.

The campaign ran through August only, and therefore, the dashboard shows a line graph showcasing the daily trend of the cost sued in the campaign. The highest cost was spent on the 28th, and the least cost was spent on the 22nd.
